# WeatherDemo-nutshell-android-basics

A small app coded during a nutshell at ONE LOGIC (www.onelogic.de) do demonstrate basic Android concepts: Activities, Views in XML and  the Android Manifest.
Bonus: Communication to a REST API and JSON handling.

This app retrieves the current weather conditions for Passau, Germany and displays it on the screen.

Before running this app, please go to WeatherFetchTask.java and insert your own APPID (API code for the weather REST API) to the API URL.
